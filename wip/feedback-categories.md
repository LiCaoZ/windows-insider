# Understand feedback categories and diagnostics

We know there's a lot of categories, which can be confusing, but filing things in the right category is key to us getting the right diagnostics and being able to help with your issue. Use this page to check if your feedback goes into the category and subcategory you think it does and to make sure you're attaching the information we need to investigate.

![Choosing Problem or Suggestion and categories while giving new feedback.](images/FBH-category.jpg)

If you’re seeing an issue from an update of Windows, be sure to file feedback under the category and subcategory for where you’re seeing the issue, not just under **Install and update**. 

## Choose a category and subcategory

When you look through the list of categories and subcategories, some likely seem straight-forward, like the Microsoft Store category for feedback on the store experience. But this guide can help you choose between some of the others.

### Apps

Use this for issues you experience using apps on your device. The subcategory should be the app's name. Do not use these categories if you are facing issues installing applications though, which should instead go to **Developer Platform** > **App Deployment**, **Install and Update** > **App installation issues**, **Gaming and Xbox** > **Game installation**, and **Apps > MSIX app** depending on the issue.

### Gaming and Xbox

Use this for issues you experience while gaming or using Xbox features on Windows, including Game Bar, using controllers, game installation, game crashes and performance, issues using your Xbox account, or recording. If your issue doesn't fit neatly into its subcategories, use **All other issues**.

### Accessibility

Use this for features we've built specifically to help users make the most of their device, especially users with functional needs, like Narrator, Magnifier, eye control, or live captions. Do not use this for just any issue accessing something. If your feedback isn't for one of these features or something available as a setting in the **Settings** > **Accessibility** section, it probably needs to be sent directly to the feature's category instead. Still be sure to tell us that it's an accessibility issue in your feedback description though.

### Customer programs

Use this for feedback on the Windows Insider Program's content or forums, like their blog posts or Answers forum.

### Desktop environment

Desktop environment includes many parts of Windows, like the Start menu and the taskbar. Some tips to avoid confusion when filing in this category:

#### (Virtual) desktops

Use this only for [the desktops that you can switch between in Task view](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/multiple-desktops-in-windows-36f52e38-5b4a-557b-2ff9-e1a60c976434). Issues for your desktop icons should go the **Desktop icons** subcategory, issues for your background and wallpaper should go to the **Background and wallpaper** subcategory, issues for windows on your desktop should go to the **DWM (Desktop Window Manager)** subcategory, and issues with the desktop right-click context menu should go to the **Right-click context menu** subcategory.

#### Clock and calendar flyout

Use this only for the taskbar date and time and the calendar that opens when you select it. Feedback for the calendar app should go to **Apps** > **Calendar** instead, and issues with your settings should go to **Settings** > **Date and Time Settings** instead.

#### Desktop icons

Use this only for desktop icon issues. Issues for the desktops that you can switch between in Task view, should go to the **(Virtual) desktops** subcategory, issues for your background and wallpaper should go to the **Background and wallpaper** subcategory, issues for windows on your desktop should go to the **DWM (Desktop Window Manager)** subcategory, and issues with the desktop right-click context menu should go to the **Right-click context menu** subcategory.

#### DWM (Desktop Window Management)

Use this for issues with using app windows on your desktop, like windows going behind other windows, their frame, mica transparency effects of the window, or the close, maximize, and minimize buttons on your app window.

#### Lock screen

Use this for the screen you see when you log in to your device with the time and some settings options. If you're having problems with the Spotlight image backgrounds here though, please use the **Windows Spotlight** subcategory instead.

#### MTC controls and audio

Use this only for the media controls and audio controls you see in the Quick Settings or using your hardware keys for volume and brightness. If your volume, audio, or microphones simply aren't working, send that feedback to **Devices and drivers** > **Audio and sound** instead. 

#### Start menu

Use this only for the Start menu, not for the taskbar, other things like apps not starting, or your device not starting up correctly. While there is a search box in the new Windows 11 Start menu, Start and search are still different features with different categories. Use **Desktop environment** > **Search** instead for your search feedback.

#### System tray 

Use this only for the right side of the taskbar with your date and time, small system icons, and the show hidden icons flyout.

#### Taskbar

Use this only for the taskbar outside of the right side with your date and time, small system icons and the show hidden icons flyout, which has its own subcategory called **System tray**. Task manager and Start menu also shouldn't go here, they have their own subcategories.

#### All other issues

Use this if you're experiencing explorer crashes when you're not sure what caused them, issues with small system dialogs that pop up as you do things like run programs, or other major issues on Windows that you're not sure where to put.

### Devices and Drivers

Use this if something is wrong with your device and its hardware, like audio or sound, or connecting to other devices, like Bluetooth, USB keyboards, printers, or scanners.

### Display and graphics

Use this if something is wrong with your display, like using multiple displays, graphics driver installation, bug check blue screens, brightness, night light, scaling, or resolutions.

### Files, folders, and online storage

Use this for any issues with your files and storage, like File Explorer, OneDrive, your storage settings, or disk space.

### Input and language

Use this for all things input, including your mouse or pen not working, the emoji panel, or keyboard and language switching. If your keyboard isn't working to type, your hardware keys aren't working, or you’re having issues with the IME (Input Method Editor) for East Asian languages, send it to the **Text input** subcategory.

### Install and update

Use this for all issues with updates, like installing an update, backup and restore, or loss of settings after an update.

### Network and internet

Use this for all issues around your internet and network connectivity, like VPNs, connecting to wi-fi, ethernet, or cellular, and the network troubleshooter.

### Power and battery

Use this for all issues with your power—like powering on or off or sleep—or with your battery—like battery saver, overheating, or app energy consumption.

### Recovery and uninstall

Use this for issues with recovery and uninstall issues like reset this PC, image backups, and USB recovery drives.

### Security and privacy

Use this for all things security, like BitLocker, encryption, Microsoft Defender, logging into your device or Windows Hello, or issues with your account.

### Settings

Use this for any issues with the Settings app, like personalization, date and time, sound, and Windows update.

## Include the diagnostics needed to investigate

In certain categories and subcategories, we need certain diagnostics attached with your report to be able to take action. Be sure to still give us a good title and good description first. [Learn more about how to give great feedback.](./feedback.md)

If your device is slow to boot up:
