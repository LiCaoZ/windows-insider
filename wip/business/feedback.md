# Give feedback as a business

Once you've had a chance to explore Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds, you and users across your organization can give us your feedback in the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) to help us fix issues, create new features and improvements, and continue to evolve Windows for everyone.

You can sign into the Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or your Microsoft Entra ID work account. When you use your organization's account, you'll be able to give us feedback on behalf of your organization to help shape Windows to meet your business's specific needs.

## Give feedback with your Microsoft account

1. Open the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) app on your device, make sure you're logged in with your registered Microsoft account by checking the person icon on the bottom of the side menu.

2. Select the **Feedback** section from the side menu.

3. Select the **+ Add new feedback** button.

4. Under **Enter your feedback**, enter a title and explain your feedback in more detail.

5. Under **Choose a category**, choose if it's a problem or suggestion. Select the best category and subcategory for your feedback from the dropdowns. 

6. Continue to find similar feedback and then add more details, like screenshots, files, and diagnostic data.

7. Submit your feedback.

## Give feedback with your work account

1. Open the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) app on your device and make sure you're logged in with your registered Microsoft Entra account by checking the person icon on the bottom of the side menu. If you're already signed in with your personal Microsoft account, you can switch to your work account by signing out and signing back in.

> [!NOTE] 
> When you log in to the Feedback Hub with your Microsoft Entra account for the first time, you'll see a popup asking for permission to access your account's data, like name, organizational tenant ID, and user ID. If you can't give it permission in the popup, Feedback Hub may be blocked for you. Your administrator can give you access in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) under **Enterprise applications** by enabling **Users can allow apps to access their data**. 

2. Select the **Feedback** section from the side menu.

3. Select the **+ Add new feedback** button.

4. Under **Enter your feedback**, enter a title and explain your feedback in more detail.

## Track feedback from your organization

When you're signed in with your Microsoft Entra account, you can also see feedback from other users in your organization.

Open the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) app on your device and make sure you're logged in with your registered Microsoft Entra account by checking the person icon on the bottom of the side menu. If you're already signed in with your personal Microsoft account, you can switch to your work account by signing out and signing back in.

2. Select the **Feedback** section from the side menu.
